----[ Purpose

    This plugin allows you to view at a glance all your Cacti hosts, and will alert you audibly when something is down.
	In addition, you may receive notification if any critical host becomes unreachable.

	Some audio clips courtesy of SoundBible.com and licensed under Creative Common and other Free to use Licenses.
	If you create an MP3 file called 'First Order Chorus.mp3' and place it in the sound folder, you may get a surprise
	if you choose to use it.

----[ Features

    Audible alert
    Can set permissions on who can view
    Can disable monitoring of a host

----[ Installation

    Install just like any other plugin, just throw it in the plugin directory,
    in a folder called monitor.
    Edit your includes/config.php and add it to your $plugins list, and you are rolling
